/**
 * @file
 * RTE Mbuf
 *
 * The mbuf library provides the ability to create and destroy buffers
 * that may be used by the RTE application to store message
 * buffers. The message buffers are stored in a mempool, using the
 * RTE mempool library.
 *
 * The preferred way to create a mbuf pool is to use
 * rte_pktmbuf_pool_create(). However, in some situations, an
 * application may want to have more control (ex: populate the pool with
 * specific memory), in this case it is possible to use functions from
 * rte_mempool. See how rte_pktmbuf_pool_create() is implemented for
 * details.
 *
 * This library provides an API to allocate/free packet mbufs, which are
 * used to carry network packets.
 *
 * To understand the concepts of packet buffers or mbufs, you
 * should read "TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 2: The Implementation,
 * Addison-Wesley, 1995, ISBN 0-201-63354-X from Richard Stevens"
 * http://www.kohala.com/start/tcpipiv2.html
